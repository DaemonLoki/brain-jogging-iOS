# brain-jogging-ios

Little game app that works like a brain jogging memory game.
Was used to play around with 

- Animations<br>
  Used Facebook's pop framework for doing animations on the cards

- Timers<br>
  Game logic so user can play for 30 seconds and then restart the game manually

- Custom Nibs<br>
  Individualized the appearance of the images and the scoreboard

- Simple Game Logic<br>
  User plays and at the end the score is shown to make it a little competitive
